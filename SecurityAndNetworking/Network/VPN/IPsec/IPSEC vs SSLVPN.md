#### What is SSL/TLS?
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a protocol for encrypting HTTP traffic, such as connections between user devices and web servers.
In addition to encrypting client-server communications in web browsing, SSL can also be used in VPNs.

- The IPsec protocol suite operates at the **network layer** of the OSI model. It runs directly on top of IP (the Internet Protocol), which is responsible for routing data packets.
- SSL operates at the application layer of the OSI model. It **encrypts HTTP traffic** instead of directly encrypting IP packets.
